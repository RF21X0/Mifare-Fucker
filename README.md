## 💡 Project Overview

**Mifare Fucker App** is a native **Android** application developed for the **reading** and **decoding** of data contained within **MIFARE Classic 1K** chips.

By leveraging your device's NFC (Near Field Communication) capabilities, the app allows you to acquire and view in a structured format:

* The Unique Identifier (UID).
* The hexadecimal content of all **16 sectors** and **64 blocks** of the MIFARE 1K chip.

This tool is perfect for security professionals, hobbyists, and anyone who needs to analyze or diagnose the functionality of their own MIFARE tags.

> **⚠️ Important Notice:** This application is provided for **educational** and **analysis** purposes only. Misuse or interaction with tags that do not belong to the user is strongly discouraged and illegal.
